	abstract = {In recent years, the use of technology for the purposes of improving and enriching traditional instructional practices has received a great deal of attention. However, few works have explicitly examined cognitive, psychological, and educational principles on which technology-supported learning environments are based. This volume attempts to cover the need for a thorough theoretical analysis and discussion of the principles of system design that underlie the construction of technology-enhanced learning environments. It presents examples of technology-supported learning environments that cover a broad range of content domains, from the physical sciences and mathematics to the teaching of language and literacy. The emphasis in this book is not on the design of educational software but on the design of learning environments. A great deal of research on learning and instruction has recently moved out of the laboratory into the design of applications in instructional settings. By designing technology-supported learning environments instructional scientists attempt to better understand the theories and principles that are explicit in their theories of learning. The contributors to this volume examine how factors such as social interaction, the creation of meaningful activities, the use of multiple perspectives, and the construction of concrete representations influence the acquisition of new information and transfer.},

research and practice in collaborative learning environments. The area of computer supported
collaborative learning (CSCL) is one in which advanced technologies have been used

Traditional desktop environments for collaborative learning have included interactions
between groups and computer agents with conversational abilities. Robots can take the
collaboration out of the computer and into the three dimensional, real world environments of
students. This symposium raises the important question of how advanced technologies, such
as robotics, may enable us to take the same insights from the area of scripted collaboration
and use them to support groups of learners in these environments. Other topic areas include
design choices in robotic features that may influence scripted interactions, social behavior,
meaningful engagement, and conditions that dynamically support situational factors and
generate collaborative learning among students},

Recent research suggests that other people have a strong influence on children's exploratory behavior. Would a curious robot elicit children's exploration and the desire to find out new things? In order to answer this question we designed a novel experimental paradigm in which a child plays an education tablet app with an autonomous social robot, which is portrayed as a younger peer. We manipulated the robot's behavior to be either curiosity-driven or not and measured the child's curiosity after the interaction. We show that some of the child's curiosity measures are significantly higher after interacting with a curious robot, compared to a non-curious one, while others do not. These results suggest that interacting with an autonomous social curious robot can selectively guide and promote children's curiosity.},

Both were enacted in the context of an approach to learning science from design called learning by design (LBD). In our first study, we designed and integrated a paper-and-pencil scaffolding tool, the design diary, into an LBD unit to support students' design-related activities. We learned two important lessons from the first study. First, we refined our understanding of the processes involved in designing and the ways we might present those processes to students. Second, and more important, we observed that in the dynamic, complex environment of the classroom, not all of the scaffolding could be provided with any one tool or agent. We found that students need multiple forms of support and multiple learning opportunities to learn science successfully from design activities. In our next study, we provided additional support through an organized system of tools and agents. Our analysis of data from the second study leads us to believe that supporting multiple students in a classroom requires us to rethink the notion of scaffolding as it applied to groups of learners in a classroom. We put forth the notion of distributed scaffolding as an approach to supporting hands-on inquiry learning in a classroom. © 2005 Wiley Periodicals, Inc. J Res Sci Teach 42: 185–217, 2005},

	abstract = {Social robots hold great promise as companions and peer learners for children, yet little is known about how they can be best designed for this population, what interaction scenarios can benefit from their use, and how they might fit into learning activities and environments. We aimed to close this gap by designing a learning-companion robot to augment guided reading activity and examined the robot's impact on an in-home reading experience. In this paper, we compared the experiences of early adolescent children aged 10 to 12 years (N = 24) who completed guided reading activities either with a learning-companion robot or as a paper-based activity in a 2-week-long, in-home field study. We found similar reading frequency and duration in both conditions and that both guided reading activities were described as positive experiences that helped to build reading skill and to sustain engagement. Children who read with the learning-companion robot further reported that the activities supported reading comprehension and motivated them to read and indicated a deepening social connection (i.e., companionship or affiliation) with the robot. We conclude that, rather than the activity falling off after a novelty effect, our simple prototype social robot is capable of preserving the benefits of an existing in-home learning activity while transforming the reading experience into a valuable, social one. Our findings contribute to an understanding of how we might capitalize on the capacity of social robots to serve as a transformative learning tool as robots become more widely available to the public.},

Three literacy teacher preparation courses during a summer session were chosen for this study based on the highly interactive nature of each course. The purpose of the study was not to determine the difference between different models of instruction, but to determine our students’ perceptions of the value of the social interaction that was taking place in our classrooms on their learning. The findings reveal that students in all three courses perceived that social interaction improved their learning by enhancing their knowledge of literacy and teaching and their critical thinking and problem-solving skills.},

These problems can be traced back to impeded social interaction between group members. Social interaction is necessary (a) for group members to learn from each other in a CSCL environment and (b) for socioemotional processes to help create a social space where trust, sense of community, and strong interpersonal relationships exist. This article introduces a theoretical framework consisting of three core elements: sociability, social space, and social presence, along with their relationships with group members’ mental models, social affordances and learning outcomes. It postulates that the three core elements influence the social interaction needed for both learning and the emergence of a social space. This framework serves as a basis for a research agenda for systematic social CSCL research.},

To that end, we developed a mentoring model in which we train high schoolers to be near-peer mentors for middle schoolers learning to program in summer camps. In this paper, we present results from a mixed-methods study where we examined the relationship between mentor relatability and middle school campers' self-efficacy and interest in CS. Pre- and post-surveys were used to measure campers' affective outcomes around computing and mentor relatability. In addition, interviews and observations were used to illustrate the mechanisms that led to change in affect. Our findings suggest that mentor relatability is a significant predictor of campers' self-efficacy and interest in CS. Results from the qualitative data further exemplify how mentor relatability was perceived and manifested in the camps.},

Qualitative methods have an essential role to play in this enterprise, particularly in understanding user needs and behaviours and evaluating situated use of technology. There are, however, a huge number of qualitative methods, often minor variants of each other, and it can seem difficult to choose (or design) an appropriate method for a particular study. The focus of this chapter is on semi-structured qualitative studies, which occupy a space between ethnography and surveys, typically involving observations, interviews and similar methods for data gathering, and methods for analysis based on systematic coding of data. This chapter is pragmatic, focusing on principles for designing, conducting and reporting on a qualitative study and conversely, as a reader, assessing a study. The starting premise is that all studies have a purpose, and that methods need to address the purpose, taking into account practical considerations.

Using an experimental design, teachers’ classrooms were assigned either to CSR or to a business-as-usual comparison condition.Multi-level analyses showed that students receiving CSR instruction scored higher on a standardized reading comprehension assessment compared to their peers in comparison classrooms (g = 0.18, p {\textless} 0.05). While implementation varied across classrooms, students in the CSR condition were observed using CSR strategies and working together in small groups. Teachers attended to the quality of student work and provided more feedback when teaching CSR.

To help address this reading gap previous research has identified a number of teaching strategies that have a positive impact on student learning outcomes, including the use of peer collaboration and complex texts. However, the contribution of Computer Supported Collaborative Learning to help address the reading gap for students attending low performing urban elementary schools has, to date, received much less attention and little is known about the ability of young students with access to the Internet to read complex texts in groups and how this impacts on individual reading comprehension scores. This study therefore examines the impact of combining the use of complex texts, collaborative learning and access to the internet on the reading comprehension scores of 58 fourth-grade students (ages 10-11). The students met once a week for an hour over six consecutive weeks and read under the following three conditions: eighth grade level texts independently, eighth grade level texts in groups with internet access and fourth grade level texts in groups with internet access. Our findings demonstrate that groups of young students with access to the internet are capable of reading complex texts with minimal teacher intervention. We also believe that this approach has the potential to help students develop both their offline and online reading comprehension skills.},

This study investigated the effect of facilitating critical thinking using a collaboration script modified from the Questioning, Reading, Answering, and Checking reading strategy (i.e., QRAC-the-Code; Berkeley \& Riccomini, 2013) on students' science reading literacy in a computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environment. Participants were 76 college students (71\% female) enrolled at a university in central Taiwan. Students were grouped by affinity grouping, where they self-selected their members, and were then randomly assigned to a collaborative learning condition with or without the collaboration script support. Overall, results showed that the collaboration script significantly enhanced students' reading literacy. Moreover, the effect was dependent upon gender and the format of tests. Males benefited more from the collaboration script on constructed-response items whereas females benefited more on multiple-choice items. Implications for instructional practices are drawn based on the findings of the study.},

The analysis is based on 316 outcomes from 143 studies that examined the effects of CSCL published between 2005 and 2014. Our analysis showed that the overall effect size of STEM CSCL was 0.51, a moderate but notable effect size in educational research. The effect was greatest on process outcomes, followed by knowledge outcomes, and affective outcomes. The sizes of the effects were moderated by types of technology and pedagogy, educational levels of learners, and learning domains. Moderators further interacted so that effects of technology and pedagogy varied depending on the modes of collaboration, learners' educational levels, and domains of learning. The current study demonstrates the overall advantage of CSCL in STEM education and highlights a need to understand how these variables may interact to contribute to overall CSCL effectiveness.},

Yet, CSCL scripts are often criticized for hampering naturally emerging collaboration. Research on the effectiveness of CSCL scripts has shown divergent results. This article reports a meta-analysis about the effects of CSCL scripts on domain-specific knowledge and collaboration skills. Results indicate that CSCL scripts as a kind of socio-cognitive scaffolding can enhance learning outcomes substantially. Learning with CSCL scripts leads to a small positive effect on domain-specific knowledge (d = 0.20) and a large positive effect on collaboration skills (d = 0.95) compared to unstructured CSCL. Further analyses reveal that CSCL scripts are particularly effective for domain-specific learning when they prompt transactive activities (i.e., activities in which a learner's reasoning builds on the contribution of a learning partner) and when they are combined with additional content-specific scaffolding (worked examples, concept maps, etc.). Future research on CSCL scripts should include measures of learners' internal scripts (i.e., prior collaboration skills) and the transactivity of the actual learning process.},

Robots working in populated environments are thus expected to demonstrate socially acceptable behaviors and to follow social norms. However, most of the recent works in this field do not address the problem of explicit representation of the social norms and their integration in the reasoning and the execution components of a cognitive robot. In this paper, we address the design of robotic systems that support some social behavior by implementing social norms. We present a framework for planning and execution of social plans, in which social norms are described in a domain and language independent form. A full implementation of the proposed framework is described and tested in a realistic scenario with non-expert and non-recruited users.},

This idea is derived from traditional classroom settings where teachers use a multitude of behavioral strategies to maintain the students' level of engagement.

In this paper, we present the robotic tutor, the methods used to engage students in the learning scenario, and results from integrating the robotic tutor in the classroom environment. Results derived from 44 students engaging with SIRT during a tablet-based math test show that, when compared to non-interactive methods, verbal cues are able to increase and/or maintain student engagement regardless of student age and math content level.},

	abstract = {Social robots are designed to promote social responses by human users.
Based on the Media Equation theory, we argue that the way in which people
interact with technology resembles the way in which humans interact with other
humans, and, crucially, that these social responses are mainly of an automatic
nature. To investigate the automaticity of social behavior towards robots, the
current study assessed a well-studied (in human-human interaction) social
behavior: interpersonal distance people keep, though not from other humans but
from a robot. Earlier research suggested that the social behavior of distance
keeping depends (amongst others) on the bodily posture of the interaction partner.
Based on these earlier studies, we expected that participants would keep an
interpersonal distance dependent on the posture of their robotic interaction partner
especially if a participant was responding in more automatic ways. We
manipulated robot posture (approachable versus less approachable) and the
cognitive load of the participant (high versus low), and measured user-robot
approach distance in ten short interaction tasks. In line with expectations, results
suggested that especially participants under high cognitive load approached the
robot closer when its posture communicated approachableness than when it
communicated less approachableness. Thereby, the current results suggested that
especially when people are cognitively distracted, their behavior towards robots is
of a social nature and comparable to their behavior when responding to other
humans. Implications for theory, research and design of social robots are discussed.},

We found that students seek activities that provide them with an appropriate level of challenge, feelings of discovery, opportunity for physicality, and a sense of responsibility for the robot. We discuss the implications of these findings with respect to building a tangible teachable robot.

We explore a novel method of Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) for storytelling and address the question how robots may best augment storytelling. In the pilot study, a humanoid robot, Aldebaran's Nao, was programmed to recite a story to 60 students aged 14 to 15. Nao delivered the performance as either an independent storyteller, or as a collaborator with a human storyteller. We assessed the effectiveness of HRC by comparing the participants' preference over the two settings. We found that 1) most participants prefer HRC over the robot-only performance (RO) and considered HRC effective; and 2) the preference in HRC is explained by the complementary strengths of the robot and human storyteller in interacting with the participants. These results, provide a first step towards effective use of robots for collaborative storytelling in daily situations.},
