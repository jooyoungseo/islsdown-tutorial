	abstract = {This volume provides an overview of the tensions, dilemmas, issues, and possibilities that characterize educational research. The contributions of more than 20 researchers examine the state of educational research, its future directions, and some of the major trends that have affected the field. The contributions are: (1) "An Auspicious Moment for Educational Research" (Ellen Condliffe Lagemann); (2) "Research and the Purposes of Education" (David K. Cohen and Carol A. Barnes); (3) "Poles Apart: Reconciling the Dichotomies in Education Research" (Theodore R. Mitchell and Analee Haro); (4) "Needed: Thoughtful Research for Thoughtful Schools" (Deborah W. Meier); (5) "Sociology and the Study of Education: Continuity, Discontinuity, and the Individualist Turn" (Charles E. Bidwell);  (6) "From Society to School and Back Again: Questions about Learning in and for a World of Complex Organizations" (Elisabeth S. Clemens); (7) "Understanding Educational Processes in an Era of Globalization: The View from Anthropology and Cultural Studies" (Kathleen Hall); (8) "Professing Educational Scholarship" (Lee S. Shulman); (9) "The Core, the Canon, and the Development of Research Skills: Issues in the Preparation of Education Researchers" (Alan H. Schoenfeld); (10) "Discipline and Disciplines in Education Research: Elusive Goals?" (Shirley Brice Heath); (11) "Culture and Commitment: Challenges for the Future Training of Education Researchers" (Vanessa Siddle Walker); (12) "Preparing Education Researchers To Practice Education Research" (Anna Neumann, Aaron M. Pallas, and Penelope  L. Peterson); (13) "The Changing Infrastructure of Education Research" (Allan Collins); (14) "Research, Reform, and Aims in Education: Modes of Action in Search of Each Other" (James G. Greeno, Ray {McDermott}, Karen A. Cole, Randi A. Engle, Shelley Goldman, Jennifer Knudsen, Beatrice Lauman, and Charlotte Linde); (15) "New Media Communications Forums for Improving Education Research and Practice" (Roy D. Pea); (16) "Multiples of Evidence, Time, and Perspective: Revising the Study of Teaching and Learning" (Deborah Loewenberg Ball and Magdalene Lampert), and (17) "Postscript: Some Reflections on Education Research" (Jerome Bruner).

Current philosophical work concerning the interpretative nature of scientific inquiry is reviewed as a context for discussing the situation of the child in developing scientific understanding. This view of learning ernphasizes the relationships among informal understanding, conceptual change, and enculturation into modes of scientific discourse. A prototype software system for supporting scientific inquiry processes in students is described.},

@book{lave_cognition_1988,
	title = {Cognition in Practice: Mind, Mathematics and Culture in Everyday Life},
	isbn = {978-0-521-35734-0},
	shorttitle = {Cognition in Practice},
	abstract = {Most previous research on human cognition has focused on problem-solving, and has confined its investigations to the laboratory. As a result, it has been difficult to account for complex mental processes and their place in culture and history. In this startling - indeed, disco in forting - study, Jean Lave moves the analysis of one particular form of cognitive activity, - arithmetic problem-solving - out of the laboratory into the domain of everyday life. In so doing, she shows how mathematics in the 'real world', like all thinking, is shaped by the dynamic encounter between the culturally endowed mind and its total context, a subtle interaction that shapes 1) Both tile human subject and the world within which it acts. The study is focused on mundane daily, activities, such as grocery shopping for 'best buys' in the supermarket, dieting, and so on. Innovative in its method, fascinating in its findings, the research is above all significant in its theoretical contributions. Have offers a cogent critique of conventional cognitive theory, turning for an alternative to recent social theory, and weaving a compelling synthesis from elements of culture theory, theories of practice, and Marxist discourse. The result is a new way of understanding human thought processes, a vision of cognition as the dialectic between persons-acting, and the settings in which their activity is constituted. The book will appeal to anthropologists, for its novel theory of the relation of cognition to culture and context; to cognitive scientists and educational theorists; and to the 'plain folks' who form its subject, and who will recognize themselves in it, a rare accomplishment in the modern social sciences.},
